# About this tool

_The Good, The Bad and The Accountant_ aims at teaching journalists and their audience about the intricacies of corruption in local budgets. It is the interactive counterpart to [Cooking Budgets](http://cookingbudgets.com/), a series of tutorials on how corruption works in Europe.

The choices you have to make in _The Good, The Bad and The Accountant_ can involve active or passive corruption. This does not mean that all civil servants are corrupt. But it does mean that corruption is a systemic issue. Anyone working near large contracts, public or private, has dealt or will deal with corruption. As we show in the tool, dealing with corruption cannot mean to simply refuse it. Refusing it might lead to conflicts with other stakeholders.

Several studies from [Sweden](http://www.nordicacademicpress.com/bok/a-clean-house/), the [Netherlands](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-01839-3_19), [Québec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charbonneau_Commission) and [Germany](https://www.amazon.de/Korruption-Deutschland-Portrait-einer-Wachstumsbranche/dp/3406510663) have shown that corruption is almost never a case of a bad apple in a barrel of clean ones. On the contrary, corruption is, almost everywhere in the European Union, a systemic problem. Journalists and the general public should know about the mechanisms that let public official use their position for private benefits. This is what this tool does.
