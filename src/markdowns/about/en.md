# About this tool

_The Good, The Bad and The Accountant_ aims at teaching journalists and their audience about the intricacies of corruption in local budgets. It is the interactive counterpart to [Cooking Budgets](http://cookingbudgets.com/), a series of tutorials on how corruption works in Europe.

The choices you have to make in _The Good, The Bad and The Accountant_ can involve active or passive corruption. This does not mean that all civil servants are corrupt. But it does mean that corruption is a systemic issue. Anyone working near large contracts, public or private, has dealt or will deal with corruption. As we show in the tool, dealing with corruption cannot mean to simply refuse it. Refusing it might lead to conflicts with other stakeholders.

Several studies from [Sweden](http://www.nordicacademicpress.com/bok/a-clean-house/), the [Netherlands](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-01839-3_19), [Québec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charbonneau_Commission) and [Germany](https://www.amazon.de/Korruption-Deutschland-Portrait-einer-Wachstumsbranche/dp/3406510663) have shown that corruption is almost never a case of a bad apple in a barrel of clean ones. On the contrary, corruption is, almost everywhere in the European Union, a systemic problem. Journalists and the general public should know about the mechanisms that let public official use their position for private benefits. This is what this tool does.

# How does it work

Users have to make decisions based on questions. Several variables help them make choices. City financials tell them how much money the city collects each year (resources) and spends (expenditures), while “reserves” tell the user how much money the city has in the bank. 
**Risk political** increases with unpopular decisions, **Risk contractors** increases when the user makes a choices that contractors won’t like and **Risk police** increases when the user does something illegal.


After each choice, there is a (risk / 10) probability of triggering a game over of the type related to the risk. E.g if **Risk police**=9, user has 9 chance out of 10 to be arrested by the police at the next step.
